# MDraw

MDraw is a research-purpose software for drawing lines on a mesh, which includes an implementation of the following papers:

Takashi Kanai, Hiromasa Suzuki:
"Approximate Shortest Path on a Polyhedral Surface and Its Applications",
Computer Aided Design, Volume 33, Number 11, pp.801-811, September 2001.

Takashi Kanai, Hiromasa Suzuki:
"Approximate Shortest Path on a Polyhedral Surface Based on Selective Refinement of the Discrete Graph and Its Applications",
Proc. Geometric Modeling and Processing 2000, pp.241-250, IEEE CS Press, Los Alamitos, CA, April 2000.

This software was originally created in 1998-1999 and was renovated so as to build successfully by Visual Studio 2015 (VS2015).

## Getting Started

Double-click src\OpenGL.sln (A solution file for VS2015) and then "build the solution", and if successfully finished, you can find an executable in src\Release\OpenGL.exe .

### Prerequisites

This software uses MFC (Microsoft Foundation Class). Then, to compile this software, VS2015 Professional or upper versions are required.
